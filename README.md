# 📋 Python List Operations

This project demonstrates basic list operations in Python, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of a specific value.

---

## 🧠 What the Program Does

- Creates an empty list called `my_list`
- Appends the values `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40`
- Inserts the value `15` at the second position
- Extends the list with `[50, 60, 70]`
- Removes the last element from the list
- Sorts the list in ascending order
- Finds and prints the index of the value `30`

## 💻 Example Output

```text
Index of 30: 4
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
